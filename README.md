# myconky
A set of Conky widgets for system monitoring. 
This is not my original creation, it is a modification of another config I found...somewhere. It was like three months ago and I lost track of the source. If you recognize it please feel free to tell me so I can add attribution.

Fair warning, if you pull this and try to implement it you'll have to save it in a weird spot or go through and change any of the spots that need a file system address. I initially saved it in ~/.config and not ~/.conky, and then put it inside several folders because I didn't really know what I was doing. (I mean I still don't, but I didn't then, either.) 

Conky version used is 1.19.6, I don't know if it will work with a newer version. I'm running this on GNOME 46 in Ubuntu 24.04.3 if that matters.

This is what it looks like on my system:

The blacked out portions are just bits of info I don't really want everyone to know.

If you have any questions and would like a somewhat prompt answer you would be better off commenting on this Reddit post:

I'm far more likely to see that in a reasonable amount of time.
